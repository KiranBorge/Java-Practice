Static control flow: - 
                      This flow runs at class loading time.

Static Control Flow:

1) Identification of static members from top to bottom
2) Execution of static variable assignment and static block from top to bottom
3) Execution of main method

   eg.  class StaticControlFlow
       {
         static int i=10;
          static
          {
            m1();
            System.out.println("First Static Block");
          }
          public static void main(String[] args)
          {
            m1();
            System.out.println("Main");
          }
          public static void m1()
          {
            System.out.println(j);
          }
          static
          {
            System.out.println("Second Static Block");
          }
          static int j=20;
       }

Static Control Flow from Parent to Child

1) Identification of static members from parent to child
2) Execution of static variable assignment and static block from parent to child
3) Excution of main method from child class

  eg.

Instance Control flow:
                      This control flow run when object will get created.
                      
 Instance control flow:-
 1) Identification of instance members from top to bottom
 2) Execution of instance variable assignment and instance block from top to bottom
 2) Execution of constructor
 
 Instance control flow in Parent child relation:
 1) Identification of instance members from Parent to Child
 2) Excution of instance variable assignment and instance block only in parent class
 3) Execution of parent constructor
 4) Execution of instance variable assignment and instance block in child class
 5) Execution of child constructor
